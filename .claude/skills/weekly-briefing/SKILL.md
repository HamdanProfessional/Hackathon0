# Weekly Briefing (CEO Briefing)

## Purpose

The Weekly Briefing skill **aggregates** data from across the vault, **analyzes** business performance against goals, **identifies** trends and bottlenecks, and **presents** actionable insights in a CEO-level executive summary. This skill **transforms** raw activity data into strategic business intelligence.

This is the **standout feature** of the AI Employee system - it transforms the AI from reactive to proactive by autonomously auditing the business and generating actionable insights.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Executive Level**: Output is concise, insight-focused, executive-ready
2. **Data-Driven**: All assertions backed by vault data and logs
3. **Proactive**: Surfaces opportunities and warnings before they become crises
4. **Action-Oriented**: Includes specific, prioritized recommendations
5. **Autonomous**: Runs automatically via Ralph Wiggum or cron
6. **Comprehensive**: Covers all business domains (email, calendar, finance, social)

### Architecture

```
Business_Goals.md (Targets)
      ↓
Logs/ (Activity Data)
      ↓
Accounting/ (Financial Data)
      ↓
Needs_Action/ (Pending Work)
      ↓
Done/ (Completed Work)
      ↓
Ralph Wiggum (Autonomous Execution)
      ↓

Dashboard.md (Update)
```

### Modularity

- **Data Aggregation**: Reads from multiple vault sources
- **Trend Analysis**: Compares current week to historical data
- **Goal Tracking**: Measures progress against Business_Goals.md
- **Insight Generation**: Identifies patterns, bottlenecks, opportunities
- **Report Generation**: Creates professional CEO briefing document

## Workflow

### 1. Data Collection Phase

**Read all relevant vault data**:
```bash
# Business targets and metrics
AI_Employee_Vault/Business_Goals.md

# Financial data
AI_Employee_Vault/Accounting/*.md

# Completed work
AI_Employee_Vault/Done/*.md

# Pending work
AI_Employee_Vault/Needs_Action/*.md

# Activity logs
AI_Employee_Vault/Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json

# Urgent emails (from weekend)
AI_Employee_Vault/Needs_Action/EMAIL_*.md

# Upcoming events
AI_Employee_Vault/Needs_Action/EVENT_*.md
```

### 2. Analysis Phase

**Business Performance Analysis**:
- Revenue vs. target (from Business_Goals.md)
- Invoice status (paid, overdue, pending)
- Expense analysis (unusual expenses, subscriptions)
- Cash position

**Work Completion Analysis**:
- Tasks completed this week
- Tasks still pending
- Bottlenecks and delays
- Productivity metrics

**Activity Pattern Analysis**:
- Email volume and response time
- Meeting frequency and duration
- Social media engagement
- Watcher trigger frequency

### 3. Insight Generation Phase

**Identify**:
- **Trends**: Improving or declining metrics
- **Bottlenecks**: Tasks taking longer than expected
- **Opportunities**: Cost savings, process improvements
- **Warnings**: Overdue payments, missed deadlines, unusual expenses
- **Achievements**: Milestones reached, goals exceeded

**Generate** proactive suggestions:
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Process improvement recommendations
- New business opportunities
- Risk mitigation strategies

### 4. Report Generation Phase

**Create** professional briefing document:
```markdown
