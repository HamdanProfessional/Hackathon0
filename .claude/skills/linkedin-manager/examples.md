# Remote Work Isn't Dead - It's Just Evolving

Here's a contrarian take:

Everyone's talking about "return to office" mandates, but the data shows something different.

**The Reality:**
- Remote work productivity is UP 15-20% (Stanford study)
- 73% of employees want flexible work options (McKinsey)
- Companies forcing RTO are seeing 30% higher attrition

**What's Actually Happening:**
Hybrid is winning, not remote OR office.

- 2-3 days in office for collaboration
- 2-3 days remote for deep work
- Flexibility is the new perk, not remote vs office

**The Smart Approach:**
1. Let teams decide their schedule
2. Office for collaboration, home for focus
3. Measure outcomes, not hours

I've seen this play out at our company: productivity UP, satisfaction UP, turnover DOWN.

The future isn't remote OR office - it's both.

What's your experience? Agree or disagree?

# 5 Tips for Managing AI Employees I Wish I Knew Earlier

Managing AI agents (Digital FTEs) is different from managing humans. Here's what I learned:

**1. Define Clear Rules of Engagement**
Create a Company_Handbook.md with explicit rules.
- What can the AI auto-approve?
- What always needs human review?
- Tone, style, and brand voice guidelines

**2. Implement Human-in-the-Loop**
Never let AI make sensitive decisions autonomously.
- Payments over $100 → Require approval
- New contacts → Review first
- Social posts → Approve before posting

**3. Use the Ralph Wiggum Loop**
AI gives up too easily. Use a persistence loop.
- Keep iterating until task is complete
- Auto-retry on transient errors
- Learn from failures

**4. Audit Everything**
Log all AI actions to track behavior.
- What did it do?
- Was it approved?
- What was the result?

**5. Treat AI Like an Employee**
Onboard it, train it, review its work.
- SKILL.md files = Training manual
- Weekly briefings = Performance review
- Company handbook = Policy manual

The bottom line: AI employees need management too, just different.
