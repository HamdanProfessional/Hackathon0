# LinkedIn Post: AI in Manufacturing 2024

## Post Content

🏭 Manufacturing is getting smarter thanks to AI.

A new McKinsey report shows 67% of manufacturers have implemented AI in at least one process, up from 45% last year. The shift is real.

**Key applications:**
• Predictive maintenance (reduces downtime by 35%)
• Quality control (defect detection 99.2% accurate)
• Supply chain optimization (inventory costs down 22%)

According to Deloitte's 2024 survey, manufacturers using AI report 15% higher productivity than competitors.

The opportunity? Start small with predictive maintenance—biggest ROI, lowest risk.
