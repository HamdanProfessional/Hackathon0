## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Twitter (X) Content Guidelines

**Length**: 200-240 characters optimal (allows for retweets with comments)

**Tone**: Conversational, authentic, value-driven

**Hashtags**: 1-3 relevant hashtags (avoid over-tagging)

**Mentions**: Use sparingly, only when relevant

**Links**: Full URLs (Twitter auto-shortens)

**Engagement**: Ask questions to encourage replies

**Timing**: Best times: 8-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 5-6 PM

**Frequency**: 3-5 tweets per day max

### Thread Guidelines

**Length**: 3-5 tweets optimal (max 10)

**Structure**:
- Tweet 1: Hook + what you'll cover
- Tweets 2-4: Main points
- Final tweet: Summary + CTA

**Formatting**:
- Use numbers to indicate thread order
- Add "🧵" emoji to first tweet
- End with "/end" marker

**Content Flow**:
- Each tweet should stand alone
- Build narrative across tweets
- Save the best point for last

## Keyword-Based Triggers

The Twitter Manager will generate content for these keywords:
- "tweet" - Create a tweet about [topic]
- "twitter thread" - Create a thread about [topic]
- "x post" - Create a post for X (Twitter) about [topic]
- "quick update" - Short, timely update
- "share on twitter" - Share content on Twitter
- "engaging question" - Question to engage audience

## Approval File Naming Convention

**Standard tweets**: `TWITTER_POST_[timestamp].md`

**Replies**: `TWITTER_REPLY_[timestamp].md`

**Threads**: `TWITTER_THREAD_[timestamp].md`

Where timestamp is: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

## Approval Workflow

### Step 1: Generation

Claude generates content based on user input:
- Creates `TWITTER_POST_*.md` in `/Pending_Approval/`
- Includes frontmatter with metadata
- Follows Twitter best practices

### Step 2: Human Review

User reviews the file in `/Pending_Approval/`:
- Check content for accuracy
- Verify character count (280 limit)
- Edit if needed
- Ensure tone matches brand

### Step 3: Approval

User moves file to `/Approved/`:
- Move = approve
- Edit before moving if needed
- File will be auto-posted

### Step 4: Publishing

System handles posting:
- `twitter_approval_monitor.py` detects file
- `twitter_poster.py` posts to Twitter
- Summary generated in `/Briefings/`
- File moved to `/Done/`

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Generate content
python .claude/skills/twitter-manager/scripts/generate_twitter_content.py \
    --vault . \
    --topic "New feature launch" \
    --tone engaging

# Test poster (dry run)
python scripts/social-media/twitter_poster.py "Test tweet" --dry-run

# Start approval monitor
python scripts/social-media/twitter_approval_monitor.py --vault .

# Test monitor (dry run)
python scripts/social-media/twitter_approval_monitor.py --vault . --dry-run
```

## Best Practices

### Content Quality

1. **Always proofread** before creating approval file
2. **Test in dry-run mode** first: `--dry-run` flag
3. **Review the output** before moving to `/Approved/`
4. **Check character count** (280 limit)
5. **Verify hashtags** are relevant

### Timing Strategy

**Best times to post**:
- 8-9 AM: Morning commute
- 12-1 PM: Lunch break
- 5-6 PM: After work
- 7-9 PM: Evening scrolling

**Frequency**:
- 3-5 tweets per day max
- Space out posts (2-3 hours apart)
- Engage with others between posts

### Engagement Tips

- **Reply to all mentions** within 24 hours
- **Retweet valuable content** from others
- **Use threads** for longer content
- **Ask questions** to boost engagement
- **Share value** 80% of the time
- **Be authentic** and conversational

### Hashtag Strategy

**Do**:
- Use 1-3 relevant hashtags
- Research trending tags in your niche
- Create a branded hashtag for your business
- Keep hashtags short and memorable

**Don't**:
- Over-hashtag (looks spammy)
- Use irrelevant tags just for reach
- Hashtag every word
- Use long, complicated tags
