# In Progress - Cloud - Shared Domain

Shared (cross-domain) items currently being processed by Cloud VM.

**Purpose:** Temporary storage for cross-domain items that are actively being worked on by Cloud.

**Lifecycle:**
1. Item created in `Needs_Action/Shared/`
2. Cloud claims item → moves here
3. Cloud processes item → moves to `Pending_Approval/` or `Done/Shared/`

**Claim-by-Move:** Moving an item here claims it for Cloud processing.
